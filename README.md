# Eat_Efficient
Time saving and food sustainable implementation of automated custom checkout system for McMaster University's food court.

Our solution is made to tackle some of the issues at La Piazza including the checkout times, sustainability and accessibility.

We think the largest issue at La Piazza are the long wait times to pay. What if there a was a system, where you could pay beforehand and after recieving your food, you don't wait in line.
