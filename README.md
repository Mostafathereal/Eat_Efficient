# Eat_Efficient
Time saving and food sustainable implementation of automated custom checkout system for McMaster University's food court.

Our solution is made to tackle some of the issues at La Piazza including the checkout times, sustainability and accessibility.

We think the largest issue at La Piazza are the long wait times to pay. What if there a was a system, where you could pay beforehand and after recieving your food, you don't wait in a line.

Our solution is to implement automated kiosks in La Piazza. You may login to the kiosks using your MacID, and a facial recognition system verifies that it is you. You can also scan your student card and enter your password. 

The kiosks allow you to order quickly and efficiently order food, giving you recommendations based on what you've eaten before, and also what other people at La Piazza have eaten the most of. 
Based on a hunger level you set before you order, the recommendations may be tweaked so that a user doesn't end up ordering more than they can handle. This would help reduce the amount of wasted food at La Piazza.
